    "section": "",
    "text": "Torpedo bats are designed to help baseball players hit better because of their smart design. They’re lighter near the handle and heavier at the end, which makes swinging faster and easier. This helps players react quickly and make solid contact with the ball more often. Since the bat is well-balanced, it’s easier to control and aim for strong hits. That means more base hits and a higher batting average. Many Major League players prefer torpedo bats because they help them hit the ball harder and perform better in games.\nSo, question 1. Do torpedo bats make a difference when it comes to having a better batting average.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(baseballr)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nmlb2025total&lt;-bref_daily_batter(\"2025-03-20\",\"2025-04-28\")|&gt;\n  filter(AB&gt;5 & BA &lt;0.6 )\n\n\nmlb2025 &lt;- bref_daily_batter(\"2025-03-20\", \"2025-04-28\") |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Dansby Swanson\",\n                     \"Elly De la Cruz\",\n                     \"Alec Bohm\",\n                     \"Francisco Lindor\",\n                     \"Ryan Jeffers\",\n                     \"Adley Rutschman\"))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = mlb2025total, aes(x = BA, y = PA), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data = mlb2025, aes(x = BA, y = PA), color = \"blue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.600)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Torpedoes do damage?\",\n    subtitle = \"The blue dots are the players who use the torpedo bat\",\n    caption = \"Source: Baseballreference | By Kobe Kritenbrink\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see with the blue dots most of the players using the torpedo bat have a batting average in the middle range and so it seems that the bat doesn’t make a Jurassic change when it comes to batting average.\nAccording to MLB.com 10% of batter’s strikeout by pitchers who throw over 100 mph this is due to the reaction time and bat speed not being up to par. But with the design of the torpedo bat, it makes it to where players can get the bat around quicker then with a normal bat helping prevent being late on those high velocity fastballs.\nSo, question 2 Do torpedo bats lead to less strikeouts for batters?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = mlb2025,\n    aes(y = Name, x = H, xend = SO),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Hits vs strikeouts of players using torpedo bats\",\n    subtitle = \"If the green dot (hits) is farther to the right then the left that is good.\",\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = \"By: Kobe Kritenbrink | Source: BaseballReference\"\n  ) \n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finally wanted to look into which teams have the most players who use the torpedo bat compared to a team who has the least number of players. The New York Yankees have the most with 6 players using the bat almost their entire starting lineup. The team with the least is the Pittsburgh Pirates who only have 1 player who uses the bat. It doesn’t take much to see the Yankees are a far better team with a 19-14 record compared to Pirates 12-22 record. But that could be due to many different factors, so I wanted to look into runs scored to see if the torpedo bat leads to more runs.\nFinal question does the torpedo bat lead to more runs as a team?\n\n\nCode\nhighvlow&lt;- c(\"Yankes\"= 155, \"Pirates\"= 102)\n\n\n\n\nCode\niron(\n  waffle(\n    parts = highvlow/5,\n    rows = 10,\n    title = \"Yankees vs Pirates scoring\",\n    xlab = \"1 square = 5 Runs\",\n    colors = c(\"black\", \"yellow\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the torpedo bat makes a big difference when it comes to scoring run int the MLB. Will the torpedo bats be a thing of the future or will this just be an experiment that fades away after a few years?"

    "text": "Pirates’ fans haven’t had much to cheer for lately as they haven’t had a winning record since 2015, but after the 2023 MLB draft some excitement has been emerged into the fans in the city of Pittsburgh, as they had drafted Paul Skenes a highly talented starting pitcher from LSU. Skenes is known for his impressive velocity, command of the ball, and a diverse  pitch arsenal.\nPaul Skenes was the 1st overall pick in the 2023 MLB draft. Skenes is a talented young star in the league, and he has the stats to prove it. He was the leader with the best era in MLB last year in 14 starts he has an impressive 11-3 record with a Pirates team that hasn’t cracked 80 wins since 2015. A big factor in a pitcher’s resume is wins percentage. This is the sane with every player in majority of sports.\nSo, the first question is how did Skenes win loss ratio compare to other top pitchers in the MLB?\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(baseballr)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\nstrikeout&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Paul Skenes\")\n\nskubal&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Tarik Skubal\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\npaul&lt;-c(\n  \"Wins\" =12,\n  \"losses\" =4,\n  7)\n\nskubal&lt;-c(\n  \"Wins\" =16,\n  \"losses\" =7\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\niron(\nwaffle(\n  paul,\n  rows = 5,\n  title = \"Pauls wins\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 result\",\n  colors = c(\"black\",\"gold\",\"white\")\n),\nwaffle(\n  skubal,\n  rows = 5,\n  title = \"Skubal wins\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 result\",\n  colors = c(\"navy\",\"orange\")\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkenes had an impressive rookie season In the MLB in 2024 but how fell did he compared to the best of the best. I used some data  fromhttps://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/reference/bref.html to see how well he  matched up with 5 of the cy young finalists including the 2 cy young award winners in Tarik Skubal, and Chris Sale.\nThe second question is does Skenes have to ERA to be in the talks as the most talented pitcher in the MLB today?\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\nSkenes&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Paul Skenes\")\n\nSkubal&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Tarik Skubal\")\n\nSale&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Chris Sale\")\n\nClase&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Emmanuel Clase\")\n\nLugo&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Seth Lugo\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\ncyyoung &lt;- bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\", \"2025-04-08\") |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Seth Lugo\", \"Emmanuel Clase\",\"Chris Sale\",\"Tarik Skubal\",\"Paul Skenes\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = cyyoung,\n    aes(x = Name, weight = ERA)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Skenes stand tall with the best in the league\",\n    y=\"ERA\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"red\", size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"dashed\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"black\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"blue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Paul Skenes’ fastball is a dominant weapon that consistently leads to strikeouts due to its elite velocity,  and deceptive release. Sitting in the upper 90s and often touching triple digits, his fastball overwhelms hitters with speed. As well as the spin rate of his fastball he has a very high spin rate leading to the illusion of it ending higher than it does resulting in hitter swinging under it.\nLast question is how much of a difference does his fastball make when it comes to strikeouts compared to other top pitchers in the league?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = cyyoung,\n    aes(y = Name, x = H, xend = SO),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Hits and Strikeouts\",\n    title = \"Hits vs Strikeouts of Cy Young Finalists\",\n    subtitle = \"The red being hits (bad) and the green being strikeouts (good)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the graph above showed Skenes is one of the best strikeout pitchers in the game and he also doesn’t give up many hits,, as he has 80 more strikeouts then hits given up which is a recipe for success.\nSo as we have seen Paul Skenes matched up very well with the best of the best in many statistical categories. The only pitcher with a better ERA is Emmanuel Clase but he’s also a reliever so doesn’t pitch as many innings as a starter would. He not only has the stats but he also has the accolades as he has won Nl ROTY and was named the starting pitcher for the NL in the All-Star game.\nCould Paul Skenes go down as one of the greatest pitchers of all time?"
