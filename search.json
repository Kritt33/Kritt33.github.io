    "text": "Pirates’ fans haven’t had much to cheer for lately as they haven’t had a winning record since 2015, but after the 2023 MLB draft some excitement has been emerged into the fans in the city of Pittsburgh, as they had drafted Paul Skenes a highly talented starting pitcher from LSU. Skenes is known for his impressive velocity, command of the ball, and a diverse  pitch arsenal.\nPaul Skenes was the 1st overall pick in the 2023 MLB draft. Skenes is a talented young star in the league, and he has the stats to prove it. He was the leader with the best era in MLB last year in 14 starts he has an impressive 11-3 record with a Pirates team that hasn’t cracked 80 wins since 2015. A big factor in a pitcher’s resume is wins percentage. This is the sane with every player in majority of sports.\nSo, the first question is how did Skenes win loss ratio compare to other top pitchers in the MLB?\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(baseballr)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\nstrikeout&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Paul Skenes\")\n\nskubal&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Tarik Skubal\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\npaul&lt;-c(\n  \"Wins\" =12,\n  \"losses\" =4,\n  7)\n\nskubal&lt;-c(\n  \"Wins\" =16,\n  \"losses\" =7\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\niron(\nwaffle(\n  paul,\n  rows = 5,\n  title = \"Pauls wins\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 result\",\n  colors = c(\"black\",\"gold\",\"white\")\n),\nwaffle(\n  skubal,\n  rows = 5,\n  title = \"Skubal wins\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 result\",\n  colors = c(\"navy\",\"orange\")\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkenes had an impressive rookie season In the MLB in 2024 but how fell did he compared to the best of the best. I used some data  fromhttps://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/reference/bref.html to see how well he  matched up with 5 of the cy young finalists including the 2 cy young award winners in Tarik Skubal, and Chris Sale.\nThe second question is does Skenes have to ERA to be in the talks as the most talented pitcher in the MLB today?\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\nSkenes&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Paul Skenes\")\n\nSkubal&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Tarik Skubal\")\n\nSale&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Chris Sale\")\n\nClase&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Emmanuel Clase\")\n\nLugo&lt;-bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\",\"2025-04-08\")|&gt;\n  filter(Name==\"Seth Lugo\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|eecho: false\ncyyoung &lt;- bref_daily_pitcher(\"2024-05-11\", \"2025-04-08\") |&gt;\n  filter(Name %in% c(\"Seth Lugo\", \"Emmanuel Clase\",\"Chris Sale\",\"Tarik Skubal\",\"Paul Skenes\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = cyyoung,\n    aes(x = Name, weight = ERA)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Skenes stand tall with the best in the league\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"red\", size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(linetype = \"dashed\", fill = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = \"black\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"blue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Paul Skenes’ fastball is a dominant weapon that consistently leads to strikeouts due to its elite velocity,  and deceptive release. Sitting in the upper 90s and often touching triple digits, his fastball overwhelms hitters with speed. As well as the spin rate of his fastball he has a very high spin rate leading to the illusion of it ending higher than it does resulting in hitter swinging under it.\nLast question is how much of a difference does his fastball make when it comes to strikeouts compared to other top pitchers in the league?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = cyyoung,\n    aes(y = Name, x = H, xend = SO),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Hits and Strikeouts\",\n    title = \"Hits vs Strikeouts of Cy Young Finalists\",\n    subtitle = \"The red being hits (bad) and the green being strikeouts (good)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the graph above showed Skenes is one of the best strikeout pitchers in the game and he also doesn’t give up many hits,, as he has 80 more strikeouts then hits given up which is a recipe for success.\nSo as we have seen Paul Skenes matched up very well with the best of the best in many statistical categories. The only pitcher with a better ERA is Emmanuel Clase but he’s also a reliever so doesn’t pitch as many innings as a starter would. He not only has the stats but he also has the accolades as he has won Nl ROTY and was named the starting pitcher for the NL in the All-Star game.\nCould Paul Skenes go down as one of the greatest pitchers of all time?"
